            <h3> Evaluation </h3>
            <br />
            <h4> Goal </h4>
            <p>Build a predictive model to estimate monthly credit card spending of individual customers based on a rich set of customer attributes, 
                including demographics, credit behavior, transaction activity, and lifestyle indicators.</p>
            <br />
            <h4> Metric </h4>
            <p> You must train and validate predictive models that estimate monthly_spend. Submissions will be evaluated based on RMSE (root mean squared error) on the scoring data. Scoring data is split into a public and private dataset. 
                Performance on the public dataset will be posted on Public Leaderboard which will be visible during the competition. 
                Score on the private dataset will be shared on the Private Leaderboard at the conclusion of the competition. Your performance will be judged based on your rank on the Private Leaderboard. Lower your RMSE, higher your rank.
                Kaggle allows you to select the submission to use for Private Leaderboard. Unless you are extremely confident in the virtues of a particular submission, it is best to allow Kaggle to automatically use your top Public Leaderboard submission.
</p>

            <br />

            <h4> Submission File </h4>
            <p> The submission file should be in text format (.csv) with only two columns, customer_id and monthly_spend. 
                The monthly_spend column must contain predicted monthly_spend. Number of decimal places to use is up to you. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

            <p> Here is an illustration in Python of how you can create a model, apply it to scoring_data.csv to prepare a submission file. </p>

                import pandas as pd

                    X = data.loc[:,['credit_score', 'travel_frequency']]
                    y = data.monthly_spend

                    from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
                    reg = LinearRegression()
                    reg.fit(X,y)
                    reg.predict(X)

                    scoring_data = pd.read_csv('scoring_data.csv')
                    scoring_data_X = scoring_data.loc[:,['credit_score', 'travel_frequency']]
                    pred = reg.predict(scoring_data_X)

                    submission_file = pd.DataFrame({'customer_id': scoring_data.customer_id, 'monthly_spend': pred})
                    submission_file.to_csv('submission_file_1.csv',index = False)

            <h4> Summary </h4>
            <p> In this project, I used Python and it's related libraries (OLS, Scikit-learn, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) to create multiple machine learning models
                to predict monthly credit card spending of individual customers based on a rich set of customer attributes, 
                including demographics, credit behavior, transaction activity, and lifestyle indicators. <br /> <br />

                Since this was a numerical outcome I focused mostly on linear regression as a way to get the most accurate predictions. I built models from simple to advance such as linear regression,
                polynomial regression, decision trees, random forests and gradient boosting. In my <span style = color:blue ; font-weight:bold> Code Reports </span> below you'll see I combined two of those
                models using a Voting Regressor to get the best possible predictions. <br /> <br />

                This assignment made me more intrigued by machine learning as I was able to apply what I've learned in class to a real-world problem. 
                I was also able to see the impact of different models on the predictions and how they can be combined to get the best possible results. I can take this knowledge 
                I have gained and apply it to other similar problems that businesses face. This challenge made me more curious as a Data Scientist and what I learned most was to ask more 
                thorough questions as I written my code. I also learned the importance of preliminary research such as preprocessing, data mining, and exploratory data analysis to get a better understanding of the problem and the dataset.
